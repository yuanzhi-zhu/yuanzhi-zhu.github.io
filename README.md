## Comment

**Comment:** currently disqus, gitment and gitalk are supported, and gitalk is recommended. The links about how to config them are pasted on Comments section in file \_config.yml.

**!!:** If you prefer disqus, due to the defect in how disqus handles username and domain-whitelist. Please remember to modify disqus.username to your own or clear this part. Record on this can be seen at [Issues#2][1].
