It feels like yesterday when I wrote my New Year Resolution for 2025.
While many (mostly good) things have happened in 2025, at this moment, I have the resolutions firmly set for 2026 and wish to avoid the mistakes made in the previous year.

Time, is the most fair resource people have. The feeling of time is related to the infomation input we receive, thus we need to experience more.
Due to the finite memorey capacity of human brain, it is more important to collect precious memories, better with treasureable people.
