## Being a Master in ETH Zurich

Within one year, this is the second time I fly from China to Europe: This time as a master student in [**ETH Zurich**]([ETH Zurich - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH_Zurich)) (Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich). From around 30/March to 28/August I was at home for my Bachelor Graduation Design, but actually I know I was not well motivated to do anything to improve myself. 

Zurich is such a different city from Munich. While people in both place speak German, but people in Zurich speak Zuri-German, which is basically another language. One thing I regret most is that I did not study German when I exchanged to TUM. Comparing to Zurich, German cities I had visited are more willing to using both German and English (one reason is that Germany  is a defeated country and we know there are still US military base in the Deutschland).

Besides the language, the people themselves are largely different, too. German, who are known for not hospitable, are more friendly than people here in general lol.

And now, from September, my new life started in Zurich.

## Study in ETH

By writing this post, it is about the end of the first semester, after the first snow in Zurich since I came. I think it is time to make a summary about study life in ETH and too see if I can do better in the coming 2021.

To be honest, my study in ETH is largely different than what I thought it would be like. I have spent lot of time in a lab when I was an undergraduate student, and in my understanding then, master is totally different from undergraduate. However, here in ETH, I feel I am still a study machine, who spends time on books and old knowledge. I want to do something interesting! I hope the situation would change the next semester when I will do a semester project.

Unless I want to get a PHD degree, I do not think most of the courses I take now will help :) One important thing I have been thinking for a long time is that I want to make money myself and balance my money and balance (indeed I try to read books about investment and invest some funds; after I have a steady incoming cash flow I will try [this](https://byvoid.com/zhs/blog/beancount-bookkeeping-1/))

All in all, I am eagerly to seek for changes in my study life. 

## Evolving Thinking

I am always proud of my ability to update my thinking after knowing more things. One time when I was talking with my friend about this, I explained it like this: 'After I collected more data(go to different places and meet different people), the weights of neural network got updated, and I have new understanding above things'. From this point to view, I know it is possible that people can be highly biased if they only collect one-sided data, which is what I try to avoid. So, let's accept more input with high signal noise ratio.
