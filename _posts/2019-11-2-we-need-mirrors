General 'mirrors' are the things that can tell us who we are

## Background

I have to admit that my speaking English is really poor. Let's back a little, I attended a class for TOEFL speaking section which made me frustrated.

## The Class
I had said that I have already taken TOEFL for three times and I got zero improvements in speaking and writing. Then I decide to take a class. 

The main content of this class is introducing the problems in this section and giving demos during the class. Besides, there will be homework you need to finish, which will be graded in the next day. The homework is a corresponding question and you have to record your answer and upload it to the teaching assistant. 

After several tries, I found that my voice was not as good as I thought at all. It was really frustrating to hear my sound from my phone: motionless, tedious and unclear.

When I heard other students' answers and the evaluation from the teacher the next day, I was sure I was totally lost in speaking.

## We need mirrors

I suddenly realized that I rarely reflected on myself, no matter in the field of study or social.

The thing is it just not too late to find this truth. All I want to do is to be a better man.
