## Background
Recently, I am preparing for applying to colleges abroad. One of the most important procedures during application is to write your personal statement(PS), which is something that gives a more alive description of your experience and pursuit.

## Something is determined
Motivative students with strong background are always prefered in the offering market. 
That is the reason a huge number of students choose to finish their summer intern abroad. Apart from PS, recommendation letters can also serve as an evaluation letter.
Universities in China, they possess unbalanced resources. For undergraduate students who want to study abroad, the labs and professors in their home universities are indeed the most essential resources. The good professors usually have abroad experience and relationships with professors there. At the early stage , students can choose to work follow such professors and get the chance to do a summer internship with the help of these professors.
As a result, from some point of view, the intern brings us not only the work experience, but also recommendation letters(RLs). This kind of RLs usually values than others because it can evaluate student both the ability of academic and their personality. Relative objective assess is somehow more real than your PS. 

## The only way out
Sadly, owning to the unbalanced resource, only the top students in the top universities in China get the internship(The competition thus is extremely exciting:D). For those normal student who want to continue student carrier in America or Europe, the PS should be highlighted, PS is the only way to let professors to have a better knowledge about your personality and motivation on research. 
Background and your previous experience(you publication/projects) are something that you can not change any more. At least for me now, the time is limited.
I have to admit that emailing professors in your dreaming school in advance is really an unefficient way.

## What should I do
By realizing all of these, all I can do is having a good sleep and moving on.
