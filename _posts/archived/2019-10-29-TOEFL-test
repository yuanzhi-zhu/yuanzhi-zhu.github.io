## Background
I am going to take my forth time TOEFL test. There is something I have to record for all of these preparing processes. 

## The experience
At the first time, I get 94 in total but that is not satisfing because the exchange program requires 95. Then at the end of that semester, I took my second TOEFL test and got 100, which is an OK score.

Now here goes the analysis, the second time is an over-all(reading, listening, speaking and writing) improvement: 28-28-22-22. Indeed, I have to admit that I have never put much attention on the out-put part, namely, speaking and writing. For me, the reading and listening scores are may limitation, then I think there is still space for improvement in the out-put part.

The third time is a tragedy and at that time I also had to prepare my first paper. I was distracted at that time and I even did not try to keep my feeling on the in-put part. As a result, I get the worst score and feel shit about this test.

Now, I know, it is but a test, which means that I can find a suitable strategy and get my dream score.

## Let just practice
Practice makes perfect.

Just do it.
