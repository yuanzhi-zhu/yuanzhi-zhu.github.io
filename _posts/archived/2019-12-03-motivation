After I have been here in Munich, my motivation just falls down to hell. Here I want to figure out the reasons for this situation.

## My previous status

I have to say, this decrement started this summer when I was in Japan for my summer internship. At that time, I admitted that I was not very interested in what I was doing, I guess it was more like a tedious job which is always the same content for a long time. Originally I thought I will be fully motivated to do everything, but I did not find the theory they can teach me(they have fantastic experimental experience and facilities), then I was just doing simulations instead of learning new things.
Two months later, I decided to do something new: try to develop a simulation program based on a wonderful open-source framework GetDp and GMSH. With the processing of investigating new things, I think I was more self-motivated at the end of my summer internship.

Besides, when I was in Japan, I started to care something other than scientific research, which also distracted me. But I know that is not the real reason. When I was in high school, I only had one goal: getting good scores in the entrance exam. At that time, I can spend a lot of time browsing the Internet especially some forums and reading detective books.


## Possible reasons I
To begin with, one possible reason is that at the start of the summer, I knew that I had already done most of the things need to apply for a graduate school, which means that I had lost the motivation to achieve the big goal to some extent. Since this situation keeps till present, this can be a possible reason.

The cons of this reason is also apparent for me, there are the previous posts of mine about the TOEFL test, but I just find that the need to get a higher score did not drive me as before, it did not give me the feeling of urgent.

## Possible reason II

Another possible reason is that I am away from the atmosphere. To be honest, I do not want this to be the case, because this may mean that my heart is not strong enough. When I was in high school, I have all the students with the same aim as me; during my second year and third year in my home university, I was used to working in the office with some Ph.D. candidates or study with my girlfriend.
After I went to Tokyo, I have to addmit that I am not that a social guy(possibly due to my poor English) and I do not get a close friend there to work/study with me. The same as me here in Munich. This is more likely to be the true reason. I need to do something to change this situation.

## My fault about Duke

I do not know why, I just found that I mis-upload my statement of the purpose after I made the payment. It is horrible, I have been frustrated for the whole day. 

One thing I have to tell myself is that at every stage my life is going from worse to better. The only thing I need to do is making sure I will never make the same mistake again.

## Conclusion
Up to now, I still do not know how to make myself motivated again, but I will try to be self-discipline from now on.

Besides, I find I rarely analyze myself, I guess I need also to do it frequently to make sure I am in the right and desired way.
