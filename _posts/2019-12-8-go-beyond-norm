## Background

Today I just watched a TED talk titled "why the majority is always wrong", which inspired me a lot.

## why the majority is always wrong

The brain is thinking to stop thinking because it takes energy.

The theory is simple, most of the people's brains are used to the autopilot mode, we are confined in the mental box. Especially when we want to do something we are used to choosing from very limited options: we are more willing to follow others, follow the existed experience.

I always believe that we need to constantly experience new things and accept (at least listen to) new ideas to keep our minds grow. This talk just makes me think of this.

## Further thought

When I was browsing some forums on the Internet, I find I was just following other's opinions. I was astonished that I almost lose the ability to critical thinking, that terrifying.

On the other hand, I think that we still need to do some regular stuff, using the inertial power to driving us more efficiently. From today on, I am gonna do fitness every two or three days.
